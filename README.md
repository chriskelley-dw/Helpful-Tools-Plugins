# Helpful-Tools-Plugins
A repository of helpful design tools and plugins to be used alongside our main tools of Figma and Zeplin.

## Tools
_TBD_

## Figma Plugins

### Versioning & History
#### [**Time Machine**](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/734492262527930956/Time-Machine)
- Saves a copy of your work, timestamped in a separate page of your file
- Easier than using Version History to see differences between versions
- Especially useful if you tend to design over the same artboard rather than duplicating

### Quickly generating content
#### [**Content Reel**](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/731627216655469013/Content-Reel)
- randomly populates layers with lists (of text or images) to make it easy to populate a list, table, multiple variants, etc.
    - can create your own lists
#### [**Faker**](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/833836762121994814/Faker)
- similar to Content Reel
- faster, but less customizable  

### Quickly changing content
#### **`cmd + /` + "select all...**
- easy, built-in, fastest, but limited in precision and control

#### **"Selection colors/styles" in Design Panel**
- easy, built-in, visual, point and click

#### [**Get>>All**](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/963807322482539548/Get%E2%80%BA%E2%80%BAall) and [**Similayer***](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/735733267883397781/Similayer)
- for selecting all layers that share a similar property
- like the built-in feature, but more robust 

#### [**Find and Replace**](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/735072959812183643/Find-and-Replace)
- for swapping out strings of text   

### *Helpful when creating components*

#### [**Text Crop**](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/951930713294228024/Text-Crop)
- removes whitespace around text
- helps you better measure distance between text and adjacent objects
    - helps make measurements more consistent with css box model
#### [**Stark**](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/732603254453395948/Stark) or [**Contrast**](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/748533339900865323/Contrast)
- color contrast checker
#### [**Round>>All**](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/939429933336921092/Round%E2%80%BA%E2%80%BAall)
- Rounds everything to nearest whole number
    - X, Y coordinates, width & height measurements, font size

### *Helpful for sharing designs with more clarity*
#### [**Autoflow**](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/733902567457592893/Autoflow)
- draws arrows from one object to another   
- will reflow as objects move around (if plugin is open)
#### [**Super Tidy**](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/731260060173130163/Super-Tidy) or [**Clean Document**](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/767379019764649932/Clean-Document) or [**Snap to Grid**](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/773875667263247070/Snap-to-Grid)
- tidies up and organizes artboards for a cleaner presentation
#### [**Rename It**](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/731271836271143349/Rename-It)
- Batch rename layers or artboards 
#### [**Annotate it!**](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/859894273811051899/Annotate-it!)
- similar to built-in comments system, but puts all comments on page rather than in Comments panel
#### [**Figma Measure**](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/739918456607459153) or [**Dimensions**](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/887996630608174929/Dimensions)
- adds redlines based on selection
- must do it element by element, so not a one stop shop, unfortunately 
#### [**Wire Box**](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/764471577604277919/Wire-Box)
- turns high fidelity mockups into wireframes
- good for **S30** conversations and presentations, good for keeping conversations and feedback controlled
- helpful if you design in high fidelity (although it really is beneficial to sketch first)
